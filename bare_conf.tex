\documentclass[conference]{IEEEtran}
% Some Computer Society conferences also require the compsoc mode option,
% but others use the standard conference format.
%
% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:

% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/epslatex/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/dblfloatfix/




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/url/
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

\begin{abstract}


The concept of Smart Grid has become popular in the recent times. The main objective in this Smart Grid is to intelligently make use of power.  It involves taking optimal actions at the production and consumption sites of electricity. In this work, we consider multiple microgrids equipped with batteries to store renewable power. At every instant, each of them receive a demand to meet. Depending on the current battery and renewable power information, they take a decision on number of power units to be bought or sold. If any of the other neighboring microgrids sell the power, they can consume it. Otherwise, they can get it from the main grid. If power is bought, it is first used to meet its demand and rest of it will be stored in the battery. Hence, there is a control decision problem on number of power units to be bought or sold at every time instant. We note that the future forecast demand and renewable units also impact this decision. Hence, we formulate this problem in the framework of Markov Decision Process and apply Reinforcement Learning algorithms to solve this problem. Through simulations, we show that the policy we obtain performs an significant improvement over traditional techniques.

\section{Introduction}


****************** Needs to be updated a lot. The below is old paper's content. Some of it will be useful. I request Sai Koti and Chandramouli to take care of this section.***************************

Electricity is one of the most important components of the modern life. According to a recent survey, there are a total of 18,452 unelectrified villages in India. Providing electricity to these villages is difficult for a number of reasons. The village may be situated very far away from the main grid and it would be difficult to establish a direct electrical line between the main grid and the village. Also, due to increasing global warming, we want to make less use of fossil fuels for the generation of power. Our objective in this work is to provide a solution to electrifying these villages.

The concept of smart grid \cite{weiss1999multiagent}, is aimed at improving traditional power grid operations.  It is a distributed energy network composed of intelligent nodes (or agents) that can either operate autonomously or communicate and share energy. The  power grid is facing wide variety of challenges due to incorporation of renewable and sustainable energy power generation sources. The aim of smart grid is to effectively deliver energy to consumers and maintain grid stability.

A microgrid is a distributed networked group consisting of renewable energy generation sources with the aim of providing energy to small areas. This scenario is being envisaged as an important alternative to the conventional scheme with large power stations transmitting energy over long distances. The microgrid technology is useful particularly in the Indian context where extending power supply from the main grids to remote villages is a challenge. While the main power stations are highly connected, microgrids with local power generation, storage and conversion capabilities, act locally or share power with a few neighboring microgrid nodes \cite{farhangi2010path}.
Integrating microgrids into smartgrid poses several technical challenges. These challenges need to be addressed in order to maintain the reliable and stable operation of electric grid.

Research on smartgrids can be classified into two areas -  Demand-side management and Supply-side management. Demand side management (DSM) (\cite{logenthiran2011multi, wang2010demand,dsm1,dsm2,dsm3,dsm4}) deals with techniques developed to efficiently use the power by bringing the customers into the play. The main idea is to reduce the consumption of power during peak time and shifting it during the other times. This is done by dynamically changing the price of power and sharing this information with the customers. Key techniques to address DSM problem in smart grid are peak clipping, valley filling,  load shifting \cite{maharjan2010demand}. In \cite{reddy2011learned, reddy2011strategy}, Reinforcement Learning (RL) \cite{sutton} is used in smart grids for pricing mechanism so as to improve the profits of broker agents who procure energy from power generation sources and sell it to consumers.  

Supply-side management deals with developing techniques to efficiently make use of renewable and non-renewable energy. In this paper, we consider one such problem of minimizing Demand-Supply deficit in microgrids. 

In our current work, we setup microgrids closer to the villages. These microgrids has power connections from the main grid and also provided with batteries that can store renewable energy sources. Owing to their cost, these batteries will have limited storage capacities. Each microgrid needs to take decision on amount of renewable energy that needs to be used at every time slot and the amount of power that needs to drawn from the main grid. Consider a scenario where, microgrids will use the renewable energy as it is generated. That is, they do not store the energy. Then, during the peak demand, if the amount of renewable energy generated is low and power obtained from the main grid is also low, it leads to huge blackout. Thus, it is important to intelligently store and use the renewable energy. In this work, we apply Multi-agent Q-learning algorithm to solve this problem. 

\section*{Organization of the Paper}	
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we formulate the problem in the framework of MDP. In Section 3, we describe the RL algorithm to solve this problem. In Section 4, we discuss experimental results. In Section 5, we provide concluding remarks followed by future work.

\section{Model and Problem}

******************************* This also needs significant improvements. Written briefly here for getting a idea about the work. I will take care of all the section from here.***************

 For every microgrid, 
\begin{itemize}
	\item State Space : $<time, net\_demand_{t},cost_{t}>$, where $net\_demand_{t}$ is the power units available at time $t$. It can be written as $net\_demand_{t} = Demand_{t} - (renewable_{t} + battery_{t}).$
	
	\item $net\_demand_{t}$ can be either positive or negative. Negative units means that the microgrid needs extra power units to meet its demand. Positive units implies it can transfer those units to other microgrids. 
	
	\item $cost_{t}$ is the price at which the power units are bought/sold. This is decided by the main grid. Note that $Demand_{t}$ and $cost_{t}$ are modeled as Markov Process, while the $renewable_{t}$ can be any stochastic process (Ex : Poisson Process.)
	
	\item Note that the cuurent time $time$ is included in the state space. This is because given a $net\_demand$, different actions are optimal at different times. For example, in the morning a solar microgrid may be better of selling the power than filling its battery. Whereas a wind microgrid can be better of buying the power units as there will be less wind power till the afternoon. 
	
	\item Action : Action taken at time $t$ will be $u_{t}$, which represents the number of units that can be borrowed/transferred. If the units are borrowed, they are first used to meet the demand and the remaining will be used to fill up the battery. 
	
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}

\item Single stage Cost function : 

\begin{align}
R_t = (u_{t}*cost_{t}) + c_{t}*(Demand_{t} - (renewable_{t}+battery_{t}+u_{t})),
\end{align}

where $c_{t}$ is the threshold for balancing the price and Demand-supply deficit. 

\end{itemize}
